# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
In Jupyter Notebook we will use Postgres, Pandas, and Python to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. We will also utilize tools in Excel for the same. 

## Database Storage
Postgres and Cloud Storage (AWS) are the databases we intend to use. 

## Machine Learning
Sklearn is the ML library we'll be using to split, train, and test the data, such as, gender, age, vaccination, hopsitalizations, and death rate. Our training and testing setup is Python (Pandas)through Jupyter Notebook.

## Dashboard
We will integrate Tableau adn Google Presentation for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on GitHub Pages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
