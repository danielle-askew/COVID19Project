# Topic: COVID19 Analysis at County Level

## Communication Protocols
* The Team will coordinate using a combination of Slack, Zoom Meetings during Monday and Wednesday classes, and additional meetings as-needed. We will use a Google Document for tracking meeting notes.

## Process ##

**Data Collection**

**Preprocessing and Machine Learning**

* This data will be consolidated into a database and the variables will be applied to a Machine Learning model to predict whether a specific county is likely to have a COVID Outbreak that exceeds the State or National Average. 
**Analysis, Presentation, and Visualization**


## Technology 

* Data is collected and preprocessed in `Jupyter Notebook` using `Pandas` and `Python`.

* Preprocessed data is connected and imported into `Postgres` using `pgAdmin` and AWS.
* The database is then connected to the Machine Learning model that has been created using 'Python', 'Pandas', and `Jupyter Notebook`
* The presentation will be displayed via ``, as well as, an interactive webpage hosted by `GitHub Pages` using `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`.

## Visualization & Dashboard

* Dashboard [Storyboard](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dCde1OCeyl3IB1D-QORw7h_S3HN5e1TztJYZq71IYIo/edit?usp=sharing) & blueprint. 

## Database ##

* Preprocessed data is connected and imported into `Postgres` using `pgAdmin`.
* The database is then connected to the Machine Learning model that has been created using `Jupyter Notebook`
* The presentation will be displayed via ``, as well as, an interactive webpage hosted by `GitHub Pages` using `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`

Additionally, the database meets all of the criteria requested for this unit's deliverables. This includes:


## Machine Learning Model ##

In this machine learning analysis, we look to explore the relationship of vaccination rate and poplulation density by County in Colorado.

**ML Goal:** Explore the relationship of COVID Vaccinations and Population Densityâ€™s Impact on Infection Rates

**Implications:**


### Preliminary Data Preprocessing 



### Preliminary Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, and Decision-Making Process

**Target:** Whether an area is likely to or unlikely to experience an elevated COVID infection rate. 

**Features:** Demographic Data such as vaccination and outbreaks. 

**Feature Engineering:**


### *Training and Testing Sets*
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The model uses the training dataset to learn from it. It then uses the testing dataset to assess its performance. If we were to use the entire dataset to train the model, we wouldn't know how well the model will perform when it encounters unseen data. We use the SciKit Learn Library to split, train, and test the data.

### *Model Choice: Limitations and Benefits*
Because we are relating many variables, we will utilize both a Supervised Decision Tree and Random Forest Machine Learning Model. Supervised Machine Learning deals with labeled datasets. This approach is appropriate for this project because we will use current infection data to run predictions on future unknown datasets.

- Decision Tree Benefits: One of the most interpretable models, as they provide a clear representation of how the model works. Easy to classify or label objects by asking a series of questions designed to zero in on the true answer.
Decision Tree Drawbacks: Can become very complex and very deep, depending on how many questions have to be answered. Deep and complex trees tend to overfit to the data and do not generalize well.

- Random Forest Benefits: Instead of having a single, complex tree like the ones created by decision trees, a random forest algorithm will sample the data and build several smaller, simpler decision trees. Each tree is simpler because it is built from a random subset of features. Random forest algorithms are beneficial because they are robust against overfitting as all of those weak learners are trained on different pieces of the data, can be used to rank the importance of input variables in a natural way, can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion, are robust to outliers and nonlinear data and run efficiently on large datasets.
Random Forest Drawbacks: The main limitation of random forest is that a large number of trees can make the algorithm too slow and ineffective for real-time predictions. In general, these algorithms are fast to train, but quite slow to create predictions once they are trained.
